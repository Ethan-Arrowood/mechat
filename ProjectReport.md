# Problem

To be able to use the MeChat app, a network application (with peer-to-peer architecture) that utilizes a TCP connection as well as 
sockets to communicate between users by implementing authentication, user-designated input for server selection, encryption, user 
account creation, log-in/log-out functionality, logging, communication between clients, sending and receiving past messages, listing
channels and users, and the ability to disconnect from the server.

# Design Workflow

With our MeChat app, we have a server set up in Javascript that communicates with the client program which is in Java. Since TCP functionality can be implemented in any coding language, effectively the two programs should be able to communicate and the app should be able to run.

# Building Up To the Solution

Topics:

## I. The Application Layer:
  
The MeChat app client intiates communication at the application level. Programs were written that utilize different end systems. In creating a network app, the client and server should be able to communicate over a network. Applications on end systems allows for rapid app development and propagation. The Client program and Server programs run on different end systems. Still, they are able to communicate over the network. We used a client-server architecture. In terms of the server: there's an always-on host, permanent IP address, and data centers for scaling. With clients: they communicate with the server, may be intermittently connected, may have dynamic IP addresses and do not communicate directly with each other.

In addition, in terms of the Application Layer, sockets process sends/receives messages to/from its socket. To receive messages, a process  must have an identifier. A host device has a unique 32-bit IP address. The identifier includes both IP address and port numbers associated with a process on a host.

## II. DNS:

Included with the Application Layer is the Domain Name System protocol, which utilizes a distributed database implemented in the hierarchy of many name servers. With this application-layer protocol, hosts and name servers communicate to resolve names (address/name translation), in the case of MeChat the host is the computer running the Client program, and the name server is the computer running the Server.js program. DNS is a core Internet function, which is implemented as an application-layer protocol and made useful for our specific purposes. One of the actions performed by DNS services is the hostname to IP address translation.

## III. The Transport Layer:

In Networking, this layer provides logical communication between app processes running on different hosts. The transport protocols run in the end systems. On the sender's side, app messages are broken into segments and passed to the network layer. As for the receiver's side, those segments are reassembled into messages, and passed to the app layer. There is more than one transport protocol available to apps. However, MeChat uses TCP only. The Transport Layer, in the case of the MeChat application and all other applications, can be summed up as logical communication between hosts, with which TCP can provide reliable, in-order delivery. It also relies on and enhances network layer services, being the next layer.

## IV. TCP
  
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) offers connection management. Before the exchanging of data, the sender and receiver engage in what is known as a “three-way handshake.” They each agree to establish connection (each knowing the other is willing to establish the connection), and they also agree on connection parameters. In closing a connection, the client and server each close their side of the connection.A TCP segment is sent with FIN bit = 1. A response is then sent with ACK. On receiving FIN, ACK can be combined with own FIN (Note: simultaneous FIN exchanges can be handled). Parallel TCP connections may be established. An application can open multiple parallel connections between two hosts.
  
## V. Socket Programming:
    
The socket programming used in the MeChat app makes it possible for the application to open a connection via a socket by using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). TCP is a reliable, byte stream-oriented Transport Layer protocol, which is why we implemented lines of code that give stream functionality such as the following:

```java    
BufferedReader inFromUser = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); 
ataOutputStream outToServer = new DataOutputStream( clientSocket.getOutputStream()); 
```
With socket programming using TCP, our Client.java file must contact the server (Server.js), however the server process must first be running. The server must have created a socket (door) that welcomes client’s contact. Thereafter the client contacts the server by:

Creating a TCP socket, specifying the IP address and port number of the server process. In the chat application's case, the user provides the IP address and port number of the desired server he/she wants to chat on, and the input is then read in to the following statement:

```java
Socket clientSocket = new Socket(ip_address, port)
```  

When the client creates a socket: client TCP establishes connection to server TCP. When contacted by client, server TCP creates new socket for the server process to communicate with that particular client. This allows the MeChat server to talk with multiple clients. The source port numbers are used to distinguish each client.

In conclusion, TCP provides reliable, in-order service. Byte-stream transfer (“pipe”) is allowed between the client and the server.
  
## VI. The Network Layer
  
A transport segment is sent from the sending to receiving host. On the sending side, segments are encapsulated into datagrams. As for the receiving side, segments are delivered to the Transport Layer. There are network layer protocols in every host, which is one of the key ingredients as to how the MeChat client communicates with the server. In terms of input port functions, at the physical layer bit-level reception occurs. At the data link layer, the Ethernet protocol is used. As for the output ports, buffering is required when datagrams arrive from fabric faster than the transmission rate. The scheduling discipline chooses among queued datagrams for transmission.
  
## VII. IP
  
The IP protocol is the primary Network Layer protocol. This is where the IP address of the MeChat server comes in handy. The protocol features addressing conventions, datagram format, and packet handling conventions. In examining the IP address itself, it is a 32-bit identifier for host, router interface. The interface is for connection between host/router. Physical link routers typically have multiple interfaces. A host typically has one or two interfaces (e.g., wired Ethernet, wireless 802.11) IP addresses are associated with each interface. Subnet masks, also called netmasks, are 32-bit numbers, like IP addresses. The first N bits are 1, and the remaining 32-N bits are 0, written in dotted-decimal notation: example: 255.255.0.0. The N tells you how many bits in the associated IP address are in the network address. It is not immediately obvious, but since the MeChat app is a networking app, ultimately subnet masks will be used.
 
Subnets consist of:
 - an IP address: 
 - a subnet part - high order bits
 - a host part - low order bits 

The purpose of the subnet is so device interfaces with the same subnet part of an IP address can physically reach each other without an intervening router. The Subnet Mask has some rules: 
 - The network portion of the IP address assigned to all hosts on a network segment must be the same.
 - All hosts on a segment must have the same subnet mask.

Finally, types of addresses include the host address, a unique address assigned to each host in a network.

# Instructions
  
1. Run MeChat server (server.js) on server computer
2. Run MeChat client (ThreadedClient.java) on host (for client 0 and client 1)
    
For client (do this for all clients simultaneously):
3. Enter IP address of MeChat server: localhost
4. Enter port number: 8124 (You should then see message "Welcome to MeChat!")
5. Run help command (This will list all available commands; enter list command for a list of users and channels)
6. Enter "login <username> <password>"
7. If user does not exist, create user account with desired username and password by entering: "new <username> <password>"
8. Once logged in, select channel by entering: "connect <channel name>" 
9. Before chatting, make sure other users are on same channel
10. Users may now begin chatting
11. Enter "logout" to log out of chat
