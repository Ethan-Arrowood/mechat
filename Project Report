#Problem

To be able to use a chat application that utilizes a TCP connection as well as sockets to communicate between users by implementing 
authentication, user-designated input for server selection, encryption and additional log-in/log-out functionality.

#Design Workflow

With our MeChat app, we have a server set up in Javascript that communicates with the client program which is in Java.
Since TCP functionality can be implemented in any coding language, effectively the two programs should be able to coomunicate and the app 
should be able to run.

Steps:

Instantiate socket
Prompt for server details
Attempt connection (try again if connection fails)
On Connection: 
Say hello
Prompt to authenticate
new <username> <password> 
if user already exists prompt 
to login instead
else write auth details to data store and prompt user to login with new details
login <username> <password> 
if incorrect username or password send msg to user to try again
if correct: 
check if username is already signed in 
if true: prompt user to try a different account
else create connection
Prompt to pick a channel 
connect <channel> 
if channel name exists add user to it, allow user to begin chatting
else, prompt to use list channels command to get list of available channels
Additional user controls:
ability to logout (logout command)
ability to disconnect from a channel or swap to another channel (connect and disconnect commands)
ability to send and recieve past messages (chat and history commands)
ability to list channels and users (list <users|channels> command)
Core functionality:
User can connect to a chat server
User can login to an account on the server
User can send messages that are broadcasted to other users on the server
Use can logout from their account 
Should keep user connected to server
Use can disconnect from the chat server 
Auto-logout if still authenticated
Future Features (in no particular order or importance):
Server can have multiple channels
Users can connect to a server and then select a channel
Users have a single login for all servers 
Servers share an authentication database
User client allows the user to select what server they want to connect to
There is an admin client for having more control over the server
Users can list all other users in a channel/server
Messages are encrypted
Users login with username and password
Application has an UI 
Mobile (React Native)
Web (React)
Desktop (Electron)
Server's utilize multiprocessing and multithreading to support client connections or channels
Server logs all traffic 
messages are not logged; just the 'when/who' sent the message information
Complete unit and integration testing
